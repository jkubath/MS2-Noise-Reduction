# MS2-Noise-Reduction
Implementing neural networks to reduce noise in MS2 spectra.

Dir: MaSS-Simulator
Description: software to generate MS2 spectrum data.
Source: https://github.com/pcdslab/MaSS-Simulator

Dir: MNIST_data
Description: Image data downloaded when running noise_reduction_tutorial.py.  Images are hand written numbers 0 to 9.

Dir: output
Description: Folder containing input, validation, and test MS2 data for noise_reduction_ms2.py.  This data was generated with the
  MaSS-Simulator software.
    no_noise: Files without the added noise peaks
    binned: Files output from protein.py that have the generated MS2 data binned.  The m/z values are binned to integer values 
    instead of float values.
